# PRODUCTION INCIDENT REPORT

## Incident Classification

**SEVERITY:** HIGH  
**PRIORITY:** P1 - Critical  
**STATUS:** ACTIVE - INVESTIGATION REQUIRED

## Incident Overview

### Basic Information

- **Incident ID:** INC-2025-0728-001
- **Date/Time:** July 28, 2025 - 11:50 PM UTC
- **Reporter:** E2E Testing System / Quality Assurance
- **System:** Resonant Production Environment
- **Environment:** https://becomeresonant.app
- **Duration:** Ongoing (>45 minutes)
- **Impact Level:** High - Core functionality unavailable

### Executive Summary

Critical production failure in journal entry creation functionality. Users cannot create new journal entries due to backend Convex mutation failures. The frontend application loads correctly, authentication works, and existing data displays properly, but the core journaling functionality is completely broken.

---

## Technical Details

### Error Information

- **Primary Error:** Convex `journalEntries:create` mutation failing
- **Request ID:** 8bcef8df795f3f77
- **Convex Backend:** https://modest-warbler-488.convex.cloud
- **Error Type:** Server Error (Non-specific)

### Console Error Messages

```
[ERROR] [CONVEX M(journalEntries:create)] [Request ID: 8bcef8df795f3f77] Server Error
[ERROR] Failed to create journal entry: ConvexError: [CONVEX M(journalEntries:create)]
[ERROR] Failed to create journal entry: Error: [CONVEX M(journalEntries:create)]
[ERROR] Failed to save journal entry: Error: [CONVEX M(journalEntries:create)]
```

### System Architecture Context

- **Frontend:** Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript
- **Backend:** Convex real-time database and serverless functions
- **Authentication:** Clerk integration
- **Deployment:** Vercel (frontend) + Convex Cloud (backend)

---

## Impact Assessment

### User Impact

- **Affected Users:** ALL production users
- **Functionality Lost:**
  - Cannot create new journal entries
  - Core value proposition completely unavailable
  - Users may experience frustration and abandon the platform
- **Business Impact:**
  - Complete loss of primary feature
  - Potential user churn
  - Reputation damage

### Working Functionality

✅ **Confirmed Working:**

- User authentication and sign-in/sign-up flows
- Frontend application loading and navigation
- Existing journal entries display correctly
- Dashboard metrics and analytics
- Relationship management features
- Real-time data synchronization for existing data
- AI analysis pipeline (for existing entries)

❌ **Confirmed Broken:**

- Journal entry creation (`journalEntries:create` mutation)
- Core journaling workflow

---

## Root Cause Analysis - Initial Hypotheses

### 1. Convex Deployment Issues (HIGH PROBABILITY)

- **Hypothesis:** Production deployment inconsistency between schema and functions
- **Evidence:** Schema shows `relationshipId` as optional, but mutation requires it
- **Investigation Required:**
  - Check if latest schema deployed to production
  - Verify function deployment status
  - Compare development vs production configurations

### 2. Schema Mismatch (HIGH PROBABILITY)

**Critical Finding:** Schema inconsistency detected

```typescript
// Schema definition (line 88):
relationshipId: v.optional(v.id('relationships')), // Allow general entries

// Mutation definition (line 10):
relationshipId: v.id('relationships'), // REQUIRED field
```

**Analysis:** The schema allows optional `relationshipId` but the mutation function requires it as mandatory. This mismatch could cause validation failures.

### 3. Environment Variable Issues (MEDIUM PROBABILITY)

- **Known Issue:** Production Clerk keys need configuration
- **Status:** DEPLOYMENT-STATUS.md indicates pending Clerk production setup
- **Impact:** Could affect user ID resolution in mutations

### 4. Database Index/Permission Issues (MEDIUM PROBABILITY)

- **Hypothesis:** Database indexes not properly deployed or user permission validation failing
- **Evidence:** Multiple user/relationship validation checks in mutation

### 5. Rate Limiting or Resource Constraints (LOW PROBABILITY)

- **Hypothesis:** Convex backend hitting resource limits
- **Investigation Required:** Check Convex dashboard for performance metrics

---

## Debugging Action Plan

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Priority 1 - Next 30 minutes)

#### 1. Convex Production Environment Validation

```bash
# Verify Convex deployment status
npm run convex:deploy
npx convex logs --watch

# Check function deployment
npx convex dashboard
```

#### 2. Schema Consistency Check

**CRITICAL FIX REQUIRED:**

```typescript
// In convex/journalEntries.ts - Line 10
// CHANGE FROM:
relationshipId: v.id('relationships'),

// CHANGE TO:
relationshipId: v.optional(v.id('relationships')),
```

#### 3. Production Environment Variables Audit

```bash
# Verify all required environment variables in Vercel
- NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL: https://modest-warbler-488.convex.cloud
- NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY: [NEEDS PRODUCTION KEY]
- CLERK_SECRET_KEY: [NEEDS PRODUCTION KEY]
- GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY: [VERIFY PRODUCTION KEY]
```

#### 4. Direct Mutation Testing

```javascript
// Test mutation directly in Convex dashboard
await ctx.runMutation(api.journalEntries.create, {
  userId: 'test_user_id',
  relationshipId: 'test_relationship_id', // Try both with and without
  content: 'Test entry',
  mood: 'happy',
  tags: ['test'],
})
```

### INVESTIGATION ACTIONS (Priority 2 - Next 60 minutes)

#### 5. Authentication Flow Validation

- Test user ID resolution in production
- Verify Clerk webhook integration
- Check user synchronization between Clerk and Convex

#### 6. Database State Validation

- Verify production database schema deployment
- Check database indexes are properly created
- Validate existing data integrity

#### 7. Network and Connectivity Testing

- Test Convex backend connectivity from production frontend
- Verify CORS configuration
- Check for any network-level blocking

### MONITORING ACTIONS (Ongoing)

#### 8. Error Rate Monitoring

- Monitor Convex dashboard for error patterns
- Track user impact metrics
- Set up alerts for error rate spikes

#### 9. User Journey Testing

- Automated testing of critical user paths
- Validation of workaround strategies
- Performance impact assessment

## Technical Investigation Details

### Convex Function Analysis

**File:** `/convex/journalEntries.ts`

**Potential Issues Identified:**

1. **Schema Mismatch (Lines 10 vs Schema Line 88):**

   ```typescript
   // Mutation requires relationshipId
   relationshipId: v.id('relationships'),

   // But schema allows optional
   relationshipId: v.optional(v.id('relationships')),
   ```

2. **Validation Logic (Lines 41-50):**

   ```typescript
   // This validation could fail if relationshipId is not properly passed
   const relationship = await ctx.db.get(args.relationshipId)
   if (!relationship) {
     throw new ConvexError('Relationship not found')
   }
   ```

3. **User Verification (Lines 35-39):**
   ```typescript
   // Could fail if user ID is not properly synchronized
   const user = await ctx.db.get(args.userId)
   if (!user) {
     throw new ConvexError('User not found')
   }
   ```

### Known Environment Issues

**From DEPLOYMENT-STATUS.md:**

- Clerk production keys not configured (Lines 23-24)
- Manual Clerk dashboard configuration required
- DNS and domain configuration pending

---

## Recommended Immediate Fixes

### 1. CRITICAL: Fix Schema Mismatch

```typescript
// File: convex/journalEntries.ts
// Line 10: Change to match schema
relationshipId: v.optional(v.id('relationships')),

// Lines 41-50: Update validation logic
if (args.relationshipId) {
  const relationship = await ctx.db.get(args.relationshipId)
  if (!relationship) {
    throw new ConvexError('Relationship not found')
  }
  if (relationship.userId !== args.userId) {
    throw new ConvexError("Unauthorized: Cannot create entry for another user's relationship")
  }
}
```

### 2. Complete Clerk Production Setup

```bash
# Follow DEPLOYMENT-STATUS.md instructions
./scripts/update-clerk-production.sh pk_live_YOUR_KEY sk_live_YOUR_KEY
```

### 3. Deploy Fixed Functions

```bash
npm run convex:deploy
```

### 4. Verify Database Indexes

```bash
# Check if all indexes from schema are deployed
npx convex dashboard
# Navigate to "Data" tab and verify indexes
```

---

## Rollback Plan

### Option 1: Emergency Schema Fix (RECOMMENDED)

1. Fix schema mismatch in `journalEntries.ts`
2. Deploy immediately to production
3. Test with minimal user impact

### Option 2: Revert to Last Known Good State

1. Identify last successful deployment timestamp
2. Revert Convex functions to previous version
3. Investigate issues in development environment

### Option 3: Temporary Workaround

1. Modify frontend to always provide a relationshipId
2. Create a "default" or "general" relationship for users
3. Deploy frontend fix while investigating backend
