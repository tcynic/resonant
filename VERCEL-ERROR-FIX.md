# Vercel Build Error Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved ✅

**Problem**: `WARNING: Unable to find source file for page _error.js with extensions: tsx, ts, jsx, js, this can cause functions config from vercel.json to not be applied`

## Root Cause

- Vercel was looking for a `_error.js` file (Pages Router pattern) but the project uses App Router
- Function configurations in `vercel.json` referenced the wrong path pattern
- Missing proper error handling pages for the App Router

## Changes Made

### 1. Created App Router Error Pages

✅ **`src/app/error.tsx`** - Client-side error boundary
✅ **`src/app/not-found.tsx`** - 404 page  
✅ **`src/app/global-error.tsx`** - Global error handler
✅ **`src/app/loading.tsx`** - Loading page

### 2. Updated Vercel Configuration

✅ **Updated `vercel.json`**:

- Changed function paths from `src/app/api/**/*.ts` to `app/api/**/*.{js,ts}`
- Updated build command to use `npm run vercel-build`

### 3. Enhanced Build Process

✅ **Updated build pipeline**:

- Environment variable verification now runs before build
- Better error messages for missing configuration
- Proper error handling for build failures

### 4. Error Page Features

- **Professional styling** with Tailwind CSS
- **Development mode debugging** (shows error stack traces in dev)
- **User-friendly messages** for production
- **Action buttons** (Try again, Go to homepage/dashboard)
- **Proper error logging** to console for monitoring

## Verification

### Build Test Results

```bash
# Before fix
WARNING: Unable to find source file for page _error.js

# After fix
✅ No _error.js warnings found
✅ Build completed successfully
```

### Error Pages Available

- `/error` - General application errors
- `/not-found` - 404 page not found
- `/global-error` - Critical application failures
- `/loading` - Loading states

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Production**: The warning should no longer appear in Vercel builds
2. **Test Error Handling**: Verify error pages work correctly in production
3. **Monitor Error Logs**: Use the error logging for debugging issues
4. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all required environment variables are set in Vercel Dashboard

## Environment Variable Issue

**Note**: The primary production issue is still the missing `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` environment variable. The error page fix resolves the build warning, but you still need to:

1. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` in Vercel Dashboard for Production environment
2. Trigger a fresh deployment
3. Verify with Playwright MCP that the site loads correctly

The build process now includes environment variable verification, so future deployments will catch this issue early.
