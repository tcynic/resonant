# CI/CD Integration and Automation System

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive CI/CD integration and automation system implemented for the Resonant project's test account system and E2E testing infrastructure.

## Architecture

### GitHub Actions Workflows

#### 1. E2E Tests (`e2e-tests.yml`)

**Purpose**: Automated end-to-end testing with Playwright MCP browser automation

**Triggers**:
- Push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Pull requests to `main`
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Features**:
- Smart change detection (only runs when relevant files change)
- Matrix strategy for parallel test execution (auth, user-journeys, advanced-features)
- Comprehensive test reporting with artifacts
- Screenshot capture on test failures
- Slack notifications for test results
- Test result comments on pull requests

**Test Groups**:
- **Auth Tests**: Authentication flows and user management
- **User Journeys**: Core user workflows (relationships, journal entries)
- **Advanced Features**: Dashboard, search, filtering, responsive design

#### 2. Test Environment Deployment (`test-environment-deployment.yml`)

**Purpose**: Automated deployment and validation of test environment

**Features**:
- Convex backend function deployment to test environment
- Test data seeding and validation
- Health checks and smoke tests
- Post-deployment validation
- Environment-specific configurations

**Deployment Steps**:
1. Environment setup and configuration
2. Convex function deployment
3. Test data seeding
4. Application build and health checks
5. Test account system validation
6. Post-deployment smoke tests

### Test Infrastructure Scripts

## Test Environment Configuration

### Environment Variables

#### Required for CI/CD

```bash
# Convex Test Environment
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL_TEST=          # Test-specific Convex deployment
CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY_TEST=               # Convex deployment key for test environment

# Clerk Test Authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY_TEST=  # Test environment Clerk keys
CLERK_SECRET_KEY_TEST=                   # Test environment Clerk secret

# CI/CD Configuration
PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000  # Test application URL
PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_ENABLED=true               # Enable MCP browser automation
PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS=true                   # Headless mode for CI
CI=true                                   # CI environment flag

# Optional Notifications
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=                        # Slack notifications webhook
```

### GitHub Secrets Configuration

#### Required Secrets

```bash
# Convex
CONVEX_URL_TEST                    # Test environment Convex URL
CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY_TEST            # Convex deployment authentication

# Clerk
CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY_TEST        # Clerk test environment public key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY_TEST             # Clerk test environment secret key

# Notifications (Optional)
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL                 # Slack webhook for notifications
```

## Test Data Management

### User Personas

The system includes 4 comprehensive test user personas:

1. **New User**: Empty state for onboarding testing
   - 0 relationships, 0 journal entries
   - Tests first-time user experience

2. **Active User**: Moderate data for typical workflows
   - 4 relationships, 12 journal entries
   - Tests standard user interactions

3. **Power User**: Extensive data for performance testing
   - 15 relationships, 50 journal entries
   - Tests scalability and performance

4. **Edge Case User**: Boundary conditions and special cases
   - 8 relationships, 25 journal entries with unicode content
   - Tests validation and error handling

### Data Isolation

- **Domain Isolation**: All test accounts use `test.resonant.local` domain
- **Environment Separation**: Dedicated test Convex deployment
- **Database Isolation**: Separate test database prevents production contamination
- **Credential Isolation**: Test-specific authentication keys

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Performance Thresholds

```javascript
const thresholds = {
  avgTestDuration: 5.0,        // seconds per test
  totalExecutionTime: 900,     // 15 minutes total
  memoryUsage: 512,           // MB peak memory
  cpuUsage: 80,               // percent peak CPU
  errorRate: 5.0,             // percent error rate
  timeoutRate: 2.0            // percent timeout rate
}
```

### Alert Categories

1. **Performance Alerts**
   - Slow test execution
   - Resource usage spikes
   - Execution time degradation

2. **Reliability Alerts**
   - High error rates
   - Flaky test detection
   - Test timeout issues

3. **Infrastructure Alerts**
   - Environment connectivity issues
   - Service availability problems
   - Configuration validation failures

### Dashboard Features

- **Real-time Metrics**: Live test execution status
- **Trend Analysis**: 7-day performance trends
- **Resource Monitoring**: Memory, CPU, and network usage
- **Alert Management**: Active alerts and recommendations
- **Historical Data**: Performance history and comparisons

## Integration with Vercel

Since Vercel automatically deploys to production from the main branch, the CI/CD system is designed to:

1. **Pre-deployment Validation**: Comprehensive testing before main branch merges
2. **Pull Request Testing**: Full test suite execution on PR creation
3. **Environment Isolation**: Test environment completely separate from production
4. **Quality Gates**: Tests must pass before merge to main branch

### Deployment Flow

```
1. Feature Branch → Pull Request
2. CI/CD Triggers → E2E Tests + Environment Deployment
3. Test Results → PR Comment + Slack Notification
4. Manual Review → Code Review + Test Validation
5. Merge to Main → Vercel Production Deployment
```

## Usage Examples

### Local Development

```bash
# Set up test environment
cp .env.local.template .env.test
