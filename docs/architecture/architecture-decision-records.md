## ADR-006: State Management Strategy

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Deciders**: Technical Team

### Context

We need a state management strategy that handles:

- Real-time data from Convex subscriptions
- Local UI state (form inputs, modal states, etc.)
- User authentication state
- Complex form state with validation
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Offline state management

### Decision

We will use a **hybrid state management approach** combining React's built-in state management with Convex's real-time subscriptions.

### Rationale

**State Management Strategy:**

1. **Server State**: Managed by Convex with `useQuery` and `useMutation`
2. **Local UI State**: React's `useState` and `useReducer`
3. **Form State**: Custom hooks with validation
4. **Authentication State**: Clerk's built-in state management
5. **Complex State**: React Context for cross-component state

**Why This Approach:**

- **Simplicity**: Leverages React's built-in capabilities
- **Real-time**: Convex handles server state synchronization automatically
- **Performance**: Minimal state management overhead
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration
- **Predictability**: Clear separation between local and server state

**Alternatives Considered:**
