### Technical Implementation Details

```typescript
// HTTP Action for AI analysis
export const analyzeJournalEntry = httpAction(async (ctx, request) => {
  // Reliable external API call from Convex serverless function
  const analysis = await callGeminiAPI(entryContent)

  // Update database with real-time subscriptions
  await ctx.runMutation(internal.journalEntries.updateAnalysis, {
    entryId,
    sentiment: analysis.sentiment,
    healthScore: analysis.healthScore,
  })
})
```
