# AI Cost Strategy and User Tiers

## Executive Summary

This document defines the comprehensive cost management strategy for AI processing in the Resonant application, ensuring AI costs remain under 25% of revenue while providing optimal user experience for both free and premium tiers.

## Cost Management Principles

### Revenue-Based Cost Control

- **Target**: AI costs ‚â§ 25% of revenue
- **Premium user revenue**: $9.99/month
- **Premium AI cost allowance**: ~$2.50/month per user
- **Free user cost**: ~$0.0112/month per active user

### Active User Definition

- **Active user**: Has created journal entry in last 30 days
- **Cost basis**: Only count costs for active users
- **Benefit**: Eliminates costs for inactive signups

## User Tier Cost Management

### Free Tier Strategy - Option B (Demonstration-Focused)

**Monthly Limits:**

- **50 AI analyses per month** (~$0.0112 cost per active user)
- **Daily limit**: 3 analyses (prevents front-loading)
- **Relationship limit**: 3 relationships maximum

**User Experience:**

```
üìä Free Plan Usage: 35/50 analyses this month
‚ú® Upgrade to Premium for unlimited AI insights
üéØ Resets on [Date]
```

**Primary Conversion Trigger: Feature Limitation**

- **Limited relationships**: Only 3 relationships maximum (vs unlimited premium)
- **No advanced insights**: Basic sentiment only (vs full pattern analysis)
- **No trends/visualizations**: Current scores only (vs historical trends)
- **No actionable suggestions**: Insights only (vs AI-generated guidance)

**Secondary Conversion Triggers:**

- **80% usage warning**: "You've used 40/50 analyses this month"
- **90% usage warning**: "Only 5 analyses remaining - upgrade for unlimited"
- **Limit reached**: "Monthly limit reached. Upgrade to continue insights"

**Cost Economics:**

- 1,000 active free users = $11.20/month cost
- 10,000 active free users = $112/month cost
- Manageable scale with conversion focus

### Premium Tier Strategy - Essential Service Model

**Monthly Progression:**

1. **0-4,000 analyses**: Full service (9% of revenue cost)
2. **4,000-6,000 analyses**: Advisory notice + tips (13.5% cost)
3. **6,000-8,000 analyses**: Smart caching mode (18% cost)
4. **8,000-10,000 analyses**: Final warning (22.5% cost)
5. **10,000+ analyses**: Essential service mode (24.7% cost)

**Essential Service Mode (Hard Limit Response):**
