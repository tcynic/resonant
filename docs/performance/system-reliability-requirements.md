# System Reliability Requirements

## Overview

This document outlines the reliability and availability requirements for the Resonant application, including uptime targets, error recovery strategies, and graceful degradation approaches designed for a startup environment.

## Uptime Targets (Startup Realistic)

### Service Availability

**Target uptime**: 99% (3.65 days downtime per year)

- **Planned maintenance**: <2 hours monthly
- **Unplanned outages**: <30 minutes per incident
- **Mean time to recovery**: <15 minutes

### Component Availability

**Managed Services SLA Dependencies:**

- **Convex database**: 99.9% (managed service SLA)
- **Vercel hosting**: 99.9% (managed service SLA)
- **Gemini Flash API**: 99.5% (Google Cloud SLA)
- **Clerk authentication**: 99.9% (managed service SLA)

## Error Recovery & Graceful Degradation

### API Failure Recovery Strategy

**Retry Configuration:**

```javascript
const retryStrategy = {
  initial_retry: 10000, // 10 seconds
  second_retry: 30000, // 30 seconds
  third_retry: 60000, // 1 minute
  fourth_retry: 180000, // 3 minutes
  max_retries: 5,
  exponential_backoff: true,
}
```

### Graceful Degradation Modes

#### Gemini API Failure

- **User experience**: "Analysis in progress..." message shown
- **Background**: Retry with escalating intervals
- **Dashboard**: Shows existing data, new insights appear when processed
- **Fallback**: Basic sentiment analysis using simpler model after 5 minutes

#### Convex Database Issues

- **User experience**: "Saving..." indicator with eventual success notification
- **Background**: Local storage backup with sync on recovery
- **Dashboard**: Cached data display with "Last updated" timestamp

#### General Network Issues

- **User experience**: Offline mode with local storage
- **Background**: Queue operations for replay on reconnection
- **Visual indicators**: Clear offline/online status

## Fault Tolerance Design

### Data Integrity Protection

**Journal Entry Protection:**

- **Local storage backup**: All entries saved locally before server submission
- **Automatic retry**: Failed saves retry automatically in background
- **User notification**: Clear status indicators for save states
- **Data validation**: Client and server-side validation prevents corruption

**Health Score Reliability:**

- **Cached calculations**: Previous scores available during recalculation
- **Incremental updates**: New data supplements existing scores
- **Rollback capability**: Ability to revert to previous score if calculation fails

### Service Dependency Management

**Third-party Service Isolation:**

- **Circuit breaker pattern**: Prevent cascade failures from external services
- **Timeout management**: Appropriate timeouts for all external calls
- **Fallback mechanisms**: Local processing when external services fail
- **Health checks**: Regular monitoring of service dependencies

**Database Resilience:**

- **Connection pooling**: Efficient database connection management
- **Query optimization**: Prevent database overload from expensive queries
- **Read replicas**: Separate read/write operations where possible
- **Backup strategies**: Regular automated backups with point-in-time recovery

## Disaster Recovery

### Data Backup Strategy

**Backup Schedule:**

- **Real-time**: Critical user data (journal entries, relationships)
- **Daily**: Full database snapshots
- **Weekly**: Complete system backups including configurations
- **Monthly**: Long-term archival backups

**Recovery Time Objectives:**

- **Critical data**: <1 hour recovery time
- **Full system**: <4 hours recovery time
- **Historical data**: <24 hours recovery time

### Business Continuity Planning

**Communication Strategy:**

- **Status page**: Real-time service status updates
- **User notifications**: In-app and email notifications for outages
- **Support channels**: Clear escalation paths for critical issues
- **Stakeholder updates**: Regular communication during incidents

**Recovery Procedures:**

- **Incident response team**: Defined roles and responsibilities
- **Escalation protocols**: Clear decision-making hierarchy
- **Recovery checklist**: Step-by-step restoration procedures
- **Post-mortem process**: Learning and improvement from incidents

## Performance Under Stress

### Load Handling Strategy

**Traffic Surge Management:**

- **Auto-scaling**: Automatic resource scaling based on demand
- **Rate limiting**: Protect services from abuse and overload
- **Queue management**: Background job processing with overflow handling
- **Caching layers**: Reduce database load during high traffic

**Graceful Performance Degradation:**

- **Priority queuing**: Critical operations (crisis detection) get priority
- **Feature toggles**: Disable non-essential features during high load
- **User communication**: Clear messaging about temporary limitations
- **Resource monitoring**: Real-time tracking of system resources

### Capacity Planning

**Growth Accommodation:**

- **Horizontal scaling**: Add resources as user base grows
- **Database sharding**: Prepare for data partitioning if needed
- **CDN utilization**: Distribute static assets globally
- **Monitoring thresholds**: Early warning systems for capacity limits

**Resource Allocation:**

- **CPU utilization**: Target <70% average, <90% peak
- **Memory usage**: Target <80% average, <95% peak
- **Database connections**: Monitor and optimize connection pooling
- **Network bandwidth**: Monitor and optimize data transfer

This reliability framework ensures Resonant can maintain service quality and user trust while operating within realistic startup constraints and preparing for future growth.
