  - **How**: Same pattern as sign-in page with appropriate copy for sign-up context

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ All code follows Next.js and React best practices
- Project Structure: ✓ Exact match to architecture specifications in Dev Notes
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Appropriate for infrastructure setup story (no business logic to test)
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 8 acceptance criteria fully implemented and verified

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Enhanced Convex client error handling (src/lib/convex.ts)
- [x] Improved middleware documentation (middleware.ts)
- [x] Added metadata and improved layout for auth pages (sign-in/sign-up)
- [x] Verified all linting and TypeScript compilation passes
- [x] Confirmed all files from Dev Agent Record exist and are properly implemented
- [ ] None - all significant improvements completed

### Security Review

✓ **Strong security posture established:**

- Environment variables properly secured in .gitignore
- Clerk middleware correctly protects all non-public routes
- No hardcoded secrets or sensitive data
- Proper authentication flow implemented
- Input validation setup ready for future development

### Performance Considerations

✓ **Good performance foundation:**

- Next.js 15 with App Router provides excellent performance
- Turbopack enabled for fast development builds
- Tailwind CSS optimized for production builds
- Environment variable validation occurs at module load (appropriate for this context)
- Static rendering enabled where possible

### Final Status

✓ **Approved - Ready for Done**

**Summary:** This is an exemplary project setup implementation. All acceptance criteria are met, the code follows best practices, and the foundation is solid for future feature development. The developer has done excellent work creating a maintainable, secure, and well-structured codebase. My refactoring improvements are minor enhancements that add polish without changing the core implementation.
