## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.1 (Project Setup):

- Next.js 15 with App Router is configured and working
- Convex backend is initialized with basic schema structure
- Clerk is installed and basic configuration is in place
- Environment variables are properly set up
- Project structure follows architecture specifications exactly

### Authentication Architecture Context

**Source: [docs/architecture/system-architecture.md#security--privacy-architecture]**

- **Authentication Provider**: Clerk handles user authentication and session management
- **Security Layers**: Client-side validation, transport security (HTTPS/TLS 1.3), server-side authentication/authorization
- **Route Protection**: Role-based access control for data privacy with secure token-based API authentication

**Source: [docs/architecture/developer-architecture.md#security-architecture]**

- Clerk provides the authentication foundation with user session management
- Real-time data synchronization ensures immediate UI updates when authentication state changes
- Input validation and sanitization must be implemented for all user inputs

### Data Models and Schema Context

**Source: [docs/architecture/system-architecture.md#database-schema-convex]**

Core Convex entities and relationships:

```mermaid
users {
    string _id PK
    string clerkId
    string email
    date createdAt
    object preferences
}

relationships {
    string _id PK
    string userId FK
    string name
    string type
    string photo
    date createdAt
    date updatedAt
}

journalEntries {
    string _id PK
    string userId FK
    string relationshipId FK
    string content
    string mood
    boolean isPrivate
    date createdAt
    date updatedAt
}
```

**Relationships:**

- users ||--o{ relationships : "has"
- users ||--o{ journalEntries : "writes"
- relationships ||--o{ journalEntries : "relates to"

### Component Architecture Context

**Source: [docs/architecture/system-architecture.md#component-architecture]**

Required file locations and components:

- Authentication routes: `src/app/(auth)/sign-in/` and `src/app/(auth)/sign-up/`
- Profile management: `src/app/profile/` (new)
- Convex functions: `convex/users.ts`, `convex/relationships.ts`, `convex/journalEntries.ts`
- Type definitions: `src/lib/types.ts` (update with data models)
- Validation schemas: `src/lib/validations.ts` (new)

### Data Flow Architecture Context

**Source: [docs/architecture/system-architecture.md#data-flow-architecture]**

Authentication and data flow sequence:

1. User authentication through Clerk
2. User data stored/synced in Convex backend
3. Real-time synchronization for data updates
4. Frontend receives immediate UI updates

### Technical Constraints

**Source: [docs/architecture/developer-architecture.md#development-considerations]**

- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with strict type checking across frontend and backend
- **Shared Type Definitions**: API contracts must use shared TypeScript types
- **Real-time Updates**: Convex provides automatic real-time updates across all connected clients
- **Security**: All data operations must include proper user authorization checks

### File Locations Based on Project Structure

**Source: [docs/architecture/developer-architecture.md#component-structure]**

- Authentication pages: `src/app/(auth)/sign-in/page.tsx`, `src/app/(auth)/sign-up/page.tsx`
- Profile page: `src/app/profile/page.tsx` (new)
- Middleware: `middleware.ts` (update existing)
- Convex functions: `convex/users.ts`, `convex/relationships.ts`, `convex/entries.ts` (new)
- Types: `src/lib/types.ts` (expand existing)
- Validation: `src/lib/validations.ts` (new)
- Utilities: `src/lib/utils.ts` (update existing)

### API Design Patterns

**Source: [docs/architecture/developer-architecture.md#data-architecture]**

All Convex functions must follow patterns:

- **Mutations**: For creating, updating, deleting data (createUser, updateRelationship, etc.)
- **Queries**: For reading data (getUserById, getRelationshipsByUser, etc.)
- **Authorization**: All operations must verify user permissions using Clerk userId
- **Validation**: Use consistent validation patterns for all inputs
- **Error Handling**: Provide clear, user-friendly error messages

## Testing

**Source: [docs/architecture/developer-architecture.md#development-considerations]**

### Testing Standards
