4. Test accounts include varied relationship and journal entry data for comprehensive testing
5. Test data can be reset/cleaned up between test runs
6. Test accounts work with Clerk authentication in test environment
7. Test database isolation prevents interference with development data
8. Playwright MCP test suite covers critical user journeys with test accounts
9. Test accounts include edge cases and boundary conditions for robust testing
10. Test account management is integrated with CI/CD pipeline

## Dev Notes

### Testing Architecture Context

**Source: [CLAUDE.md#testing-strategy]**

- **E2E Tests**: Use Playwright MCP for authentication and user flow testing
- **Test Pattern**: Focus on critical user journeys and form validations
- **Authentication**: Requires real email verification in development

### Test Account Requirements

**Source: [CLAUDE.md#playwright-mcp-testing]**

- Authentication requires real email verification in development
- Test authentication flows and component interactions
- Focus on critical user journeys and form validations

### Database Schema for Testing

**Source: [CLAUDE.md#database-schema-convex]**

Test accounts will need realistic data for:

- **users**: User profiles with Clerk integration
- **relationships**: Various relationship types and statuses
- **journalEntries**: Diverse content with moods, tags, and relationships
- **healthScores**: AI-calculated metrics (when implemented)

### Test Environment Configuration

**Required Test Environment Variables:**

```bash
# Test Convex Environment
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL_TEST=        # Test-specific Convex deployment

# Test Clerk Authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY_TEST=  # Test environment keys
CLERK_SECRET_KEY_TEST=                   # Test environment keys

# Playwright MCP Configuration
PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000  # Test application URL
PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_ENABLED=true               # Use MCP browser automation
PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS=true                   # For CI environment
```

### Test Data Design Patterns

#### Test User Personas

1. **New User (Empty State)**
   - No relationships or journal entries
   - Tests onboarding and first-time user experience

2. **Active User (Moderate Data)**
   - 3-5 relationships with various types
   - 10-15 journal entries with different moods and tags
   - Tests typical user workflows

3. **Power User (Extensive Data)**
   - 10+ relationships with complex data
   - 50+ journal entries spanning multiple months
   - Tests performance and pagination

4. **Edge Case User (Boundary Conditions)**
   - Maximum length content and edge case data
   - Special characters and unicode content
   - Tests validation and error handling

### Playwright MCP Testing Patterns

#### Authentication Flow Testing with MCP

```typescript
// Example test pattern for authentication using Playwright MCP
test('user can sign up and access dashboard', async () => {
  await mcp__playwright__browser_navigate({ url: '/sign-up' })
  await signUpWithTestAccountMCP(testUsers.newUser)
  // Use MCP browser automation for form interactions
  await mcp__playwright__browser_type({
    element: 'email input field',
    ref: '[data-testid="email-input"]',
    text: testUsers.newUser.email,
  })
  await mcp__playwright__browser_click({
    element: 'sign up button',
    ref: '[data-testid="sign-up-button"]',
  })
  // Verify navigation and content
  await mcp__playwright__browser_wait_for({ text: 'Welcome' })
})
```

#### Component Interaction Testing with MCP

```typescript
// Example test pattern for component interactions using Playwright MCP
test('user can create journal entry with relationships', async () => {
  await authenticateAsMCP(testUsers.activeUser)
  await mcp__playwright__browser_navigate({ url: '/journal/new' })
  await fillJournalEntryMCP(testJournalData.basicEntry)
  await selectRelationshipsMCP(['Partner', 'Friend'])
  await mcp__playwright__browser_click({
    element: 'save entry button',
    ref: '[data-testid="save-entry"]',
  })
  await mcp__playwright__browser_wait_for({ text: 'Entry saved' })
})
```

### Performance and Scalability Considerations

**Source: [docs/business/PRD.md#technical-requirements]**

- Test accounts should not impact production performance metrics
- Test data volume should reflect realistic usage patterns
- Test isolation prevents performance degradation during development

### Security Considerations

**Source: [docs/architecture/developer-architecture.md#security-architecture]**

- Test accounts use separate authentication keys and environments
- Test data does not contain real personal information
- Test environment isolation prevents security vulnerabilities

## Testing

### Test Account System Validation

#### Unit Tests for Test Utilities

- Test data factory functions for consistency
- Test account creation and cleanup utilities
- Test environment configuration validation

#### Integration Tests for Test Infrastructure

- Test database seeding and cleanup processes
- Test account authentication flows
- Test data isolation between test runs

#### E2E Test Coverage Requirements

- **Authentication Flows**: Sign-up, sign-in, logout, profile management
- **Relationship Management**: Create, edit, delete, search relationships
- **Journal Entry System**: Create, edit, delete, tag, mood selection
- **Dashboard Functionality**: Data display, navigation, real-time updates
- **Form Validation**: Error handling, field validation, success states
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile and desktop viewport testing

#### Performance Testing with Test Accounts

- Page load times with various data volumes
- Component rendering performance with large datasets
- Database query performance with test data

### Test Data Validation Requirements

- Test data must be deterministic and reproducible
- Test accounts must have consistent identifiers for reliable testing
- Test data must cover edge cases and boundary conditions
