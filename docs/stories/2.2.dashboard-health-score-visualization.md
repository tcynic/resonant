```typescript
// Health Scores Table (already implemented in convex/schema.ts)
healthScores: defineTable({
  relationshipId: v.id('relationships'),
  userId: v.id('users'),
  overallScore: v.number(), // 0-100 scale
  componentScores: v.object({
    sentiment: v.number(),
    emotionalStability: v.number(),
    energyImpact: v.number(),
    conflictResolution: v.number(),
    gratitude: v.number(),
    communicationFrequency: v.number(),
  }),
  lastUpdated: v.number(),
  dataPoints: v.number(), // Number of entries used in calculation
})

// AI Analysis Table (already implemented)
aiAnalysis: defineTable({
  journalEntryId: v.id('journalEntries'),
  relationshipId: v.id('relationships'),
  userId: v.id('users'),
  analysisType: v.string(),
  analysisResults: v.object({

### Health Score Algorithm Implementation

**Source: [docs/algorithm-ai/core-algorithm-methodology.md]**

**Health Score Calculation Components**:

1. **Sentiment Analysis (35% weight)**: Average sentiment from recent entries
2. **Emotional Stability (25% weight)**: Consistency in emotional patterns
3. **Energy Impact (20% weight)**: Positive vs negative energy from interactions
4. **Conflict Resolution (10% weight)**: How conflicts are handled over time
5. **Gratitude Expression (5% weight)**: Frequency of gratitude mentions
6. **Communication Frequency (5% weight)**: Regular interaction patterns

**Calculation Formula**:

```typescript
overallScore =
  (sentiment * 0.35 +
    emotionalStability * 0.25 +
    energyImpact * 0.2 +
    conflictResolution * 0.1 +
    gratitude * 0.05 +
    communicationFrequency * 0.05) *
  dataQualityMultiplier
```

### Technical Constraints and Requirements

**Source: [docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#react-nextjs-standards]**

**React Component Standards**:

- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces
- Implement proper loading states and error boundaries
- Follow mobile-first responsive design principles
- Use Server Components where possible, Client Components for interactivity

**Performance Requirements**:

- Dashboard must load within 2 seconds
- Chart animations should be smooth (60fps)
- Support lazy loading for entry history
- Implement proper data caching strategies

**Accessibility Standards**:

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Proper ARIA labels for charts and interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatible

### Chart Library Selection

**Source: [docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#third-party-integrations]**

Based on project requirements, consider these options:

1. **Recharts**: React-native charting library with TypeScript support
2. **Chart.js with react-chartjs-2**: Widely used, good performance
3. **Victory**: Composable React components for data visualization

Recommendation: Recharts for TypeScript integration and React-first design.

### Convex Query Patterns

**Source: [docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#convex-standards]**

**Dashboard Query Implementation**:

```typescript
// Efficient dashboard data query
export const getDashboardData = query({
  args: { userId: v.id('users') },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // Get user's relationships
    const relationships = await ctx.db
      .query('relationships')
      .withIndex('by_user', q => q.eq('userId', args.userId))
      .collect()

    // Get health scores for all relationships
    const healthScores = await Promise.all(
      relationships.map(rel =>
        ctx.db
          .query('healthScores')
          .withIndex('by_relationship', q => q.eq('relationshipId', rel._id))
          .order('desc')
          .first()
      )
    )

    // Get recent entries
    const recentEntries = await ctx.db
      .query('journalEntries')
      .withIndex('by_user', q => q.eq('userId', args.userId))
      .order('desc')
      .take(10)

    return {
      relationships,
      healthScores: healthScores.filter(Boolean),
      recentEntries,
    }
  },
})
```

### Environment Configuration

**Source: [docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#environment-configuration]**

**No additional environment variables required** - Dashboard uses existing Convex and authentication infrastructure.

## Testing

**Source: [docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]**

### Test File Location

- Component tests: `src/components/features/dashboard/__tests__/`
- Page tests: `src/app/dashboard/__tests__/`
- Hook tests: `src/hooks/__tests__/dashboard/`
- Convex function tests: `convex/__tests__/healthScores.test.ts`

### Testing Framework Requirements

- **Jest 30.0.4**: Primary testing framework with TypeScript support
- **React Testing Library**: For component testing with user behavior focus
- **@testing-library/jest-dom**: Enhanced DOM assertions

### Specific Testing Requirements for Dashboard

- Mock Convex queries with realistic health score data
- Test responsive behavior across different screen sizes
- Test chart interactions and tooltip functionality
- Test loading states and error scenarios

- Test real-time data updates with mock Convex subscriptions

### Testing Standards Pattern

```typescript
// Dashboard Component Testing Pattern
describe('HealthScoreCard', () => {
  const mockHealthScore = {
    overallScore: 85,
    componentScores: {
      sentiment: 8.5,
      emotionalStability: 7.8,
      energyImpact: 9.2,
      conflictResolution: 8.0,
      gratitude: 7.5,
      communicationFrequency: 8.8,
    },
    lastUpdated: Date.now(),
    dataPoints: 15
  }

  it('should display health score with proper formatting', () => {
    render(<HealthScoreCard healthScore={mockHealthScore} relationshipName="Partner" />)

    expect(screen.getByText('85')).toBeInTheDocument()
    expect(screen.getByText('Partner')).toBeInTheDocument()
    expect(screen.getByText('15 entries')).toBeInTheDocument()
  })

  it('should handle missing health score data', () => {
    render(<HealthScoreCard healthScore={null} relationshipName="Partner" />)

    expect(screen.getByText('No data available')).toBeInTheDocument()
  })

  it('should be accessible with proper ARIA labels', () => {
    render(<HealthScoreCard healthScore={mockHealthScore} relationshipName="Partner" />)

    expect(screen.getByLabelText(/health score for partner/i)).toBeInTheDocument()
  })
})
```

### Review Date: 2025-07-21

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The Dashboard & Health Score Visualization implementation demonstrates **strong architectural foundations** with comprehensive feature coverage. The codebase follows modern React/Next.js patterns with proper TypeScript typing, effective error handling, and good separation of concerns. However, several critical issues were identified and addressed during the review.

**Strengths:**
