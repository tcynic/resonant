### Architecture Context

**Source: [docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#http-actions-development-patterns]**

**Circuit Breaker Pattern Implementation:**

Current circuit breaker implementation (convex/utils/circuit_breaker.ts) provides:

- QueueCircuitBreaker class with comprehensive state management
- Configurable failure thresholds and timeouts
- Health status monitoring with recommendations
- Error classification for circuit breaker decisions (shouldTripCircuitBreaker)
- Recovery detection (isRecoverableError)

```typescript
// Current Circuit Breaker Enhancement Needed
export const analyzeJournalEntry = httpAction(async (ctx, args) => {
  // Use existing QueueCircuitBreaker with database persistence
  const circuitBreaker = new QueueCircuitBreaker({
    failureThreshold: 5,
    timeoutMs: 60000,
    halfOpenMaxAttempts: 3,
  })

  // Check if circuit allows execution
  if (!circuitBreaker.canExecute()) {
    // Trigger fallback analysis
    return await ctx.runMutation(internal.fallback.processFallbackAnalysis, {
      entryId: args.entryId,
      reason: 'circuit_breaker_open',
    })
  }

  try {
    // Existing API call logic
    const response = await fetch(GEMINI_API_ENDPOINT, requestConfig)

    if (!response.ok) {
      // Record failure and check if circuit should trip
      const error = `API Error: ${response.status}`
      if (shouldTripCircuitBreaker(error)) {
        circuitBreaker.recordFailure(error)
      }
      throw new Error(error)
    }

    // Record success
    circuitBreaker.recordSuccess()
    return processSuccessfulResponse(response)
  } catch (error) {
    // Use existing enhanced retry logic with circuit breaker integration
    return await handleRetryWithCircuitBreaker(ctx, args, error)
  }
})
```

**Queue Integration Points:**

- Queue system provides sophisticated foundation with priority escalation (convex/utils/retry_strategy.ts)
- Dead letter queue stores permanently failed items with comprehensive metadata (deadLetterQueue, deadLetterReason, deadLetterCategory)
- Priority system supports normal/high/urgent with intelligent escalation based on error types
- Queue metrics integration already tracks performance, wait times, and processing attempts
- Existing queue configuration (convex/scheduler/queue_config.ts) provides error-specific retry limits and backoff multipliers

### Database Schema Requirements

**Source: [convex/schema.ts] - Extending Existing aiAnalysis Table**

Extend existing aiAnalysis table with comprehensive error handling fields:

```typescript
// Add these fields to existing aiAnalysis table (already has processingAttempts, lastErrorMessage, etc.)
// Circuit Breaker Integration
circuitBreakerState: v.optional(v.object({
  service: v.string(),                   // Service identifier (e.g., 'gemini_2_5_flash_lite')
  state: v.union(                        // Circuit breaker state at time of processing
    v.literal('closed'),
    v.literal('open'),
    v.literal('half_open')
  ),
  failureCount: v.number(),              // Failures at time of processing
  lastReset: v.optional(v.number()),     // Last circuit breaker reset timestamp
})),

// Enhanced Error Classification (extends existing lastErrorMessage)
lastErrorType: v.optional(v.union(
  v.literal('network'),
  v.literal('rate_limit'),
  v.literal('timeout'),
  v.literal('validation'),
  v.literal('service_error'),
  v.literal('authentication')
)),

// Retry History (enhances existing processingAttempts)
retryHistory: v.optional(v.array(v.object({
  attempt: v.number(),
  timestamp: v.number(),
  delayMs: v.number(),
  errorType: v.string(),
  errorMessage: v.string(),
  circuitBreakerState: v.string(),
}))),

// Fallback Analysis Results
fallbackUsed: v.optional(v.boolean()),
fallbackConfidence: v.optional(v.number()),    // 0-1 confidence score
fallbackMethod: v.optional(v.string()),        // 'keyword_sentiment', 'rule_based', etc.
fallbackMetadata: v.optional(v.object({
  keywordsMatched: v.array(v.string()),
  rulesFired: v.array(v.string()),
  processingTimeMs: v.number(),
})),

// Recovery and Upgrade Tracking
recoveryAttempted: v.optional(v.boolean()),
upgradedFromFallback: v.optional(v.boolean()),  // True if this result replaced a fallback
originalFallbackId: v.optional(v.string()),     // Reference to original fallback result
recoveryTimestamp: v.optional(v.number()),

// Enhanced Error Context (builds on existing fields)
errorContext: v.optional(v.object({
  httpActionId: v.optional(v.string()),          // From existing field
  requestId: v.optional(v.string()),
  serviceEndpoint: v.optional(v.string()),
  totalRetryTime: v.optional(v.number()),        // Total time spent in retries
  finalAttemptDelay: v.optional(v.number()),
  escalationPath: v.optional(v.array(v.string())), // Priority escalation history
})),
```

**New Lightweight Tables for Monitoring:**

```typescript
// Circuit breaker status cache (for fast lookups)
circuitBreakerStatus: defineTable({
  service: v.string(),
  isOpen: v.boolean(),
  failureCount: v.number(),
  lastFailure: v.optional(v.number()),
  nextAttemptTime: v.optional(v.number()),
  updatedAt: v.number(),
}).index('by_service', ['service'])

// Error rate tracking (for analytics)
errorMetrics: defineTable({
  service: v.string(),
  timeWindow: v.number(), // Hour bucket for aggregation
  errorCount: v.number(),
  successCount: v.number(),
  avgProcessingTime: v.optional(v.number()),
  costImpact: v.optional(v.number()),
}).index('by_service_time', ['service', 'timeWindow'])
```

  },
}
```

// Fallback sentiment analysis using keyword matching
export const SENTIMENT_KEYWORDS = {
  positive: {
    keywords: [
      'happy',
      'joy',
      'love',
      'excited',
      'wonderful',
      'amazing',
      'great',
      'fantastic',
    ],
    weights: { love: 2.0, amazing: 1.8, wonderful: 1.6, default: 1.0 },
  },

    keywords: [
      'sad',
      'angry',
      'frustrated',
      'disappointed',
      'terrible',
      'awful',
      'hate',
    ],
    weights: { hate: -2.0, terrible: -1.8, awful: -1.6, default: -1.0 },
  },
  relationship_positive: {
    keywords: [
      'connection',
      'support',
      'understanding',
      'communication',
      'trust',
    ],
    weights: { trust: 1.5, connection: 1.3, default: 1.1 },
  },
  relationship_negative: {
    keywords: [
      'conflict',
      'argument',
      'distance',
      'misunderstanding',
