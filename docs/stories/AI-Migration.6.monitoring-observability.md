- `apiUsage` table: Comprehensive API usage tracking with cost monitoring
- `performanceMetrics` table: System performance tracking and analysis
- `systemLogs` table: Application-wide logging with structured metadata

**Monitoring Architecture Requirements:**

1. **Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard:**

   ```typescript
   // Performance monitoring functions needed
   export const getSystemHealthMetrics = query({
     args: {},
     handler: async ctx => {
       const [successRate, errorRate, avgProcessingTime, costMetrics] =
         await Promise.all([
           calculateSuccessRate(ctx, { timeWindow: '24h' }),
           calculateErrorRate(ctx, { timeWindow: '1h' }),
           calculateAvgProcessingTime(ctx, { timeWindow: '24h' }),
           calculateCostMetrics(ctx, { timeWindow: '24h' }),
         ])

       return {
         successRate,
         errorRate,
         avgProcessingTime,
         costMetrics,
         status: determineOverallHealth({ successRate, errorRate }),
         alerts: getActiveAlerts(ctx),
       }
     },
   })
   ```

2. **Alert Management System:**

   ```typescript
   // Alert configuration system
   export const ALERT_THRESHOLDS = {
     success_rate: {
       warning: 0.9, // Below 90% success rate
       critical: 0.85, // Below 85% success rate
       emergency: 0.75, // Below 75% success rate
     },
     cost_budget: {
       warning: 0.8, // 80% of budget consumed
       critical: 0.95, // 95% of budget consumed
       daily_spike: 2.0, // 200% of average daily cost
     },
     processing_time: {
       warning: 30000, // >30 seconds average
       critical: 60000, // >60 seconds average
     },
   }
   ```

  thresholds: v.object({
    warning: v.optional(v.number()),
    critical: v.optional(v.number()),
    emergency: v.optional(v.number()),
  }),
  recipients: v.array(v.string()), // Email addresses or user IDs
  enabled: v.boolean(),
  lastTriggered: v.optional(v.number()),
  createdBy: v.id('users'),
  updatedAt: v.number(),
}).index('by_type', ['alertType'])

// Add monitoring alerts table
monitoringAlerts: defineTable({
  alertType: v.string(),
  severity: v.union(
    v.literal('warning'),
    v.literal('critical'),
    v.literal('emergency')
  ),
  message: v.string(),
  triggeredAt: v.number(),
  acknowledgedAt: v.optional(v.number()),

// Add budget tracking table
budgetTracking: defineTable({
  timeWindow: v.string(), // 'daily', 'weekly', 'monthly'
  budgetLimit: v.number(),
  currentSpend: v.number(),
  projectedSpend: v.number(),
  alertThreshold: v.number(), // Percentage (0.8 = 80%)
  windowStart: v.number(),
