# Epic 6: Unified Navigation & User Experience

## Epic Overview

**Epic ID**: EPIC-006  
**Title**: Unified Navigation System & Enhanced User Experience  
**Priority**: P0 (Critical for usability and user retention)  
**Status**: 🏗️ READY FOR DEVELOPMENT (HYBRID APPROACH)  
**Story Points**: 56 (Phase 1 - Core Navigation) + 7 (Phase 2 - Post Epic 5)  
**Sprint Allocation**: 4-5 sprints (Phase 1)  
**Dependencies**: Epic 1 (Core Foundation) ✅ COMPLETE

**Epic Goal**: Create a seamless, intuitive navigation system that connects all application features through unified UI components, contextual wayfinding, and enhanced user journey flows.

## **🚀 HYBRID DELIVERY APPROACH**

**Phase 1 - Core Navigation (IMMEDIATE)**: Deliver 80% of navigation value without Epic 5 dependency  
**Phase 2 - Onboarding Integration (POST-EPIC-5)**: Complete remaining integration after Epic 5 completion

This approach enables immediate user value while maintaining future integration capability.

## **📋 DEPENDENCY STATUS UPDATE**

**✅ Epic 1 (Core Foundation)**: COMPLETE - Authentication, database schema, and core infrastructure operational  
**❌ Epic 5 (Onboarding)**: NOT STARTED - Required for Story 6.6 only

**✅ SOLUTION**: Hybrid approach delivers 7 of 8 stories immediately (56 of 63 story points) while deferring only the onboarding-dependent story until Epic 5 completion.

**Business Value**:

- Reduce user navigation confusion by 80%
- Increase feature discovery rate from 25% to 70%
- Improve session duration by 40% through better feature connectivity
- Reduce support tickets related to "can't find feature" by 90%
- Increase daily active user retention by 25%

## Problem Statement

### Current State Analysis

The Resonant application currently suffers from **navigation fragmentation**:

1. **No Unified Navigation**: Each page exists in isolation with no persistent navigation system
2. **Poor Feature Discovery**: Users can't easily discover or access different app features
3. **Broken User Journeys**: No logical flow between related features (journal → insights → relationships)
4. **Lack of Context**: Users lose orientation when navigating between different sections
5. **Missing Quick Actions**: No shortcuts for common tasks like "Create New Entry" or "View Latest Insights"

### Technical Gaps Identified

From codebase analysis (`/src/app/`):

- No shared navigation components in `/src/components/layout/`
- Individual pages use isolated `Link` components without centralized navigation logic
- No breadcrumb system or contextual navigation
- Missing global app bar or sidebar structure
- No navigation state management or active route indication

### User Impact

- **High Bounce Rate**: Users leave after using single features
- **Low Feature Adoption**: Advanced features like insights and search remain underutilized
- **Frustrating UX**: Users report difficulty finding basic functionality
- **Reduced Engagement**: Session times remain low due to navigation friction

## Technical Architecture

### Component Structure

```
src/components/layout/
├── AppShell.tsx              # Main layout wrapper (Story 6.0)
├── NavigationProvider.tsx    # State management context (Story 6.0)
├── AppNavBar.tsx             # Top navigation bar (Story 6.1)
├── AppSidebar.tsx            # Collapsible sidebar (Story 6.2)
├── Breadcrumb.tsx            # Breadcrumb navigation (Story 6.3)
├── QuickActions.tsx          # FAB and shortcuts (Story 6.4)
├── NavigationTour.tsx        # Onboarding integration (Story 6.6)
├── MobileNavigation.tsx      # Mobile-specific nav (Story 6.7)
└── __tests__/                # Comprehensive test suite
```

### State Management

```typescript
// Navigation Context (Implemented in Story 6.0)
interface NavigationState {
  currentRoute: string
  breadcrumbs: BreadcrumbItem[]
  sidebarCollapsed: boolean
  recentItems: RecentItem[]
  quickActions: QuickAction[]
  notifications: NotificationCount
  userPreferences: NavigationPreferences
}

// Navigation Actions
type NavigationAction =
  | { type: 'SET_ROUTE'; route: string }
  | { type: 'TOGGLE_SIDEBAR' }
  | { type: 'ADD_RECENT_ITEM'; item: RecentItem }
  | { type: 'UPDATE_BREADCRUMBS'; breadcrumbs: BreadcrumbItem[] }
  | { type: 'SET_NOTIFICATIONS'; count: NotificationCount }
  | { type: 'UPDATE_PREFERENCES'; preferences: NavigationPreferences }
```

### Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading**: Load navigation components progressively
- **Caching**: Cache recent items and breadcrumb data
- **Debouncing**: Debounce search input and quick actions
- **Virtual Scrolling**: For large navigation lists
- **Bundle Splitting**: Separate navigation code into its own chunk
