# Epic: AI Analysis Architecture Migration

## Epic Overview

**Epic ID**: EPIC-AI-MIGRATION  
**Title**: Migrate AI Analysis from Client-Side to HTTP Actions Architecture  
**Priority**: P0 (Critical - Fixes 25% failure rate)  
**Status**: In Progress (5 of 7 stories completed)  
**Business Value**: High - Reduces AI analysis failure rate from 25% to <5%

## Problem Statement

The current AI analysis system has a critical architectural flaw - it attempts to run Node.js-dependent AI modules within Convex's serverless environment, causing a 25% failure rate with "promises that never resolve" errors. This significantly impacts user experience and trust in AI features.

**Current Issues:**

- 25% AI analysis failure rate
- Node.js dependencies failing in Convex serverless environment
- Promises never resolving due to `setInterval` and other client-side dependencies
- Inconsistent AI processing pipeline
- Poor error handling and recovery

## Target Architecture

Based on the architecture document at `docs/architecture-update1.md`, migrate to:

- **HTTP Actions for AI Processing**: Move AI calls to Convex HTTP Actions that can handle external API calls
- **Queue-Based Processing**: Use Convex Scheduler for reliable async processing
- **Real-Time Status Updates**: Maintain responsive UI through real-time status subscriptions
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Circuit breakers, retries, and fallback analysis
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Track success rates, costs, and performance metrics

## Success Criteria

- **Reliability**: AI analysis success rate >95%
- **Performance**: Average processing time <30 seconds
- **User Experience**: Real-time status updates with no UI blocking
- **Monitoring**: Complete observability of AI processing pipeline
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation when external APIs fail

## User Stories

### Story 3: Real-Time Status Updates ✅ **COMPLETED**

**As a** journal user  
**I want** to see real-time updates on my AI analysis progress  
**So that** I know when analysis is complete and can view results immediately

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [x] Show progress indicators in UI
- [x] Display estimated completion time
- [x] Provide real-time error messages and retry options
- [x] Ensure status updates work across multiple browser tabs

**Story Points:** 5  
**Sprint:** 2
