# Epic: LangExtract Integration - Brownfield Enhancement

**Epic ID:** LangExtract-Integration  
**Epic Type:** Brownfield Enhancement  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** In Progress  
**Created:** August 4, 2025

## Epic Goal

Integrate Google's LangExtract library as a preprocessing layer for journal entry analysis to provide standardized structured data extraction that enhances trend analysis capabilities and reduces maintenance of custom pattern extraction logic.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context

- **Current functionality:** AI analysis pipeline using custom pattern extraction functions for themes, triggers, and communication styles in `convex/utils/ai_bridge.ts`
- **Technology stack:** Next.js, TypeScript, Convex, Google Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite, HTTP Actions pipeline
- **Integration points:** AI analysis HTTP Actions, queue processing system, fallback analysis functions

### Enhancement Details

- **What's being added:** LangExtract preprocessing layer that standardizes text parsing before existing AI analysis
- **How it integrates:** Fits within existing HTTP Actions pipeline as a preprocessing step, maintaining all existing functionality
- **Success criteria:** Structured data extraction operational with ‚â•95% reliability, no degradation to existing AI analysis pipeline, enhanced data available for future analytics

## Business Value

- **Immediate:** Standardized data extraction reduces maintenance of custom pattern matching code
- **Future:** Enhanced structured data enables more sophisticated trend analysis and relationship insights
- **Risk Mitigation:** Feature flag allows safe rollback if issues arise
- **Technical Debt:** Replaces manual pattern extraction with industry-standard library

## Stories

1. **[Story 1: LangExtract Core Integration](./story-langextract-1-core-integration.md)** - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - Install and configure LangExtract package
   - Create preprocessing function with proper error handling
   - Integrate into existing HTTP Actions pipeline with feature flag

2. **[Story 2: Enhanced Data Schema & Analytics Foundation](./story-langextract-2-enhanced-data-schema.md)** - üîÑ IN PROGRESS
   - Update AnalysisResult interface to include structured data fields
   - Modify database schema to capture LangExtract output
   - Enhance dashboard components to display structured insights

3. **[Story 3: Integration Testing & Production Readiness](./story-langextract-3-integration-testing.md)** - ‚è≥ PENDING
   - End-to-end testing with existing AI pipeline
   - Performance testing to ensure no degradation
   - Feature flag management and rollback procedures

## Compatibility Requirements

- ‚úÖ **Existing APIs remain unchanged** - LangExtract adds preprocessing only
- ‚úÖ **Database schema changes are backward compatible** - additive fields only
- ‚úÖ **UI changes follow existing patterns** - enhanced dashboard displays
- ‚úÖ **Performance impact is minimal** - preprocessing adds <2s to analysis time

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** LangExtract preprocessing failure could break AI analysis pipeline
- **Mitigation:** Feature flag controls activation, comprehensive fallback to existing analysis functions
- **Rollback Plan:** Disable feature flag to return to current manual pattern extraction

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [x] Existing AI analysis functionality verified through testing (Story 1)
- [x] LangExtract preprocessing integrated without breaking current pipeline (Story 1)
- [ ] Enhanced structured data available for future analytics development
- [ ] No regression in AI analysis reliability (maintain >95% success rate)
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately
- [ ] Feature flag management documented

## Implementation Notes

- **Feature Flag:** `LANGEXTRACT_ENABLED` environment variable controls activation
- **Fallback Strategy:** Graceful degradation to existing manual pattern extraction
- **Performance Target:** <2 seconds additional latency for preprocessing
- **Reliability Target:** ‚â•95% success rate for structured data extraction

## Dependencies

- **External:** LangExtract TypeScript library (installed)
- **Internal:** Existing AI analysis pipeline, HTTP Actions system
- **Environment:** Google Gemini API access (already configured)
