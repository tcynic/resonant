# Quality Assurance Processes & Tools - Overview

## Overview

This document serves as the central hub for all quality assurance processes and tools used in the Resonant application. Our QA strategy ensures code quality, security, performance, and maintainability through automated processes, quality gates, and continuous monitoring.

**ðŸ“š This document has been organized into focused, actionable guides for better navigation and implementation.**

## QA Documentation Structure

### ðŸŽ¯ **Core QA Foundation**

- **[QA Philosophy & Strategy](qa-philosophy-and-strategy.md)** - Overall QA approach, principles, and quality gates
- **[Automated Code Review](automated-code-review.md)** - CI/CD pipelines, ESLint configuration, and automated quality checks
- **[Git Workflows and Hooks](git-workflows-and-hooks.md)** - Pre-commit hooks, commit standards, and Git workflow automation

### ðŸ”’ **Security & Analysis**

- **[Static Analysis and Security](static-analysis-and-security.md)** - SonarCloud, security scanning, TypeScript strict mode, and vulnerability management
- **[Dependency and Build Validation](dependency-and-build-validation.md)** - Dependency management, build optimization, and deployment validation

### ðŸ“Š **Monitoring & Reporting**

- **[Production Monitoring](production-monitoring.md)** - Application performance monitoring, error tracking, health checks, and alerting
- **[Quality Metrics and Reporting](quality-metrics-and-reporting.md)** - Quality dashboards, coverage analysis, performance budgets, and trend analysis
- **[Documentation Quality Assurance](documentation-quality-assurance.md)** - Documentation validation, content freshness, and maintenance workflows

## Quick Implementation Guide

### ðŸš€ **Getting Started (Day 1)**

1. Read [QA Philosophy & Strategy](qa-philosophy-and-strategy.md) for foundational understanding
2. Set up [Git Workflows and Hooks](git-workflows-and-hooks.md) for immediate quality gates
3. Configure [Automated Code Review](automated-code-review.md) for CI/CD pipeline

### ðŸ“ˆ **Week 1 Implementation**

1. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Set up Husky and lint-staged from [Git Workflows guide](git-workflows-and-hooks.md)
2. **Code Analysis**: Configure ESLint and TypeScript strict mode from [Static Analysis guide](static-analysis-and-security.md)
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Implement GitHub Actions from [Automated Code Review guide](automated-code-review.md)

### ðŸ”§ **Month 1 Full Implementation**

1. **Security Scanning**: Complete security pipeline from [Static Analysis guide](static-analysis-and-security.md)
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Set up monitoring from [Production Monitoring guide](production-monitoring.md)
3. **Quality Reporting**: Implement dashboards from [Quality Metrics guide](quality-metrics-and-reporting.md)

## Quality Standards Summary

### **Core Quality Metrics**

- **Code Coverage**: â‰¥ 80% overall, â‰¥ 90% for new code
- **Security**: Zero high/critical vulnerabilities
- **Performance**: Lighthouse score â‰¥ 80, bundle size within budgets
- **Type Safety**: Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- **Code Quality**: ESLint score â‰¥ 95%

### **Quality Gates**

1. **Pre-commit**: Linting, formatting, type checking, related tests
2. **Pull Request**: Full test suite, security scan, performance check
3. **Pre-deployment**: Integration tests, security validation
4. **Post-deployment**: Health checks, performance monitoring

### **Tool Stack Overview**

- **Static Analysis**: ESLint, TypeScript, SonarCloud, Prettier
- **Security**: Snyk, Semgrep, CodeQL, npm audit, FOSSA
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright
- **Performance**: Lighthouse CI, Bundle Analyzer, Web Vitals
- **Monitoring**: Sentry, Performance API, Health Checks

## Process Integration

### **Development Workflow Integration**

Each QA process is designed to integrate seamlessly with the development workflow:

1. **Write Code** â†’ Pre-commit hooks validate locally
2. **Create PR** â†’ Automated code review pipeline runs
3. **Merge to Main** â†’ Full validation and deployment pipeline
4. **Deploy** â†’ Production monitoring and alerting active

### **Team Responsibilities**

- **Developers**: Follow local quality practices, respond to quality feedback
- **QA Team**: Maintain processes, analyze metrics, provide training
- **DevOps**: Maintain CI/CD pipelines, monitor infrastructure
- **Security**: Review security reports, maintain security policies

## Troubleshooting & Support

### **Common Issues**

- **Slow CI/CD Pipeline**: Review [Automated Code Review](automated-code-review.md) optimization tips
- **Security Alerts**: Follow procedures in [Static Analysis and Security](static-analysis-and-security.md)
- **Performance Issues**: Use monitoring tools from [Production Monitoring](production-monitoring.md)
- **Coverage Problems**: Apply strategies from [Quality Metrics and Reporting](quality-metrics-and-reporting.md)

### **Getting Help**

1. **Process Questions**: Refer to specific guide documents
2. **Tool Configuration**: Check implementation sections in each guide
3. **Metrics Analysis**: Use reporting tools from [Quality Metrics guide](quality-metrics-and-reporting.md)
4. **Emergency Issues**: Follow incident response procedures in [Production Monitoring](production-monitoring.md)

## Continuous Improvement

### **Regular Reviews**

- **Weekly**: Quality metrics review using [Quality Metrics guide](quality-metrics-and-reporting.md)
- **Monthly**: Process effectiveness assessment
- **Quarterly**: Tool evaluation and strategy updates

### **Feedback Loops**

- **Developer Experience**: Regular surveys on tool effectiveness
- **Process Metrics**: Automated tracking of quality gate performance
- **Outcome Metrics**: Production incident correlation with quality measures
